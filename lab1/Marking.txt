Documentation 3/3
    Great!
Code Correctness 3/3
    You should be checking if proc_create returns NULL and returning -ENOMEM if so.
    Looks good!
Code Clarity 2/2
    You should reference TASK_RUNNING, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and TASK_STOPPED rather than hard-coding values.
    Looks good!
Testing 1/2
    It looks like you forgot to commit and push some of your test output files.
